# The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes
A story about little Phippy the giraffe and her life aboard Captain Kube's boat.

I modified the original story slightly and put it in PowerPoint format to suit my purposes. The PowerPoint file is stored in this repository.

I did this work for Reach Out and Read (https://www.reachoutandread.org/); I am proud to take part in the
#ReadTogether project for children and families. Shout out to my employer, West Monroe (https://wmp.com), who allowed me to spend an afternoon volunteering my time to create this material and record myself reading it.
